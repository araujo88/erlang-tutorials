Erlang tutorials

## Erlang projects suggestions

1. **Chat Application**: Build a simple real-time chat application using Erlang's built-in support for concurrency and message passing. This project could demonstrate the ability to handle multiple user connections simultaneously.

2. **Task Queue System**: Develop a system that can manage tasks distributed across multiple workers. This would show your skills in handling asynchronous processes and work distribution.

3. **Web Crawler**: Create a web crawler that can fetch data from multiple websites concurrently. This project will utilize Erlang's abilities to manage several HTTP requests in parallel.

4. **File Watcher System**: Implement a system that monitors changes in file directories and sends notifications when changes occur. This can be useful for understanding file system operations and event handling in Erlang.

5. **IoT Device Simulator**: Simulate an IoT environment where multiple devices communicate with a server to update their status. This can help demonstrate your understanding of Erlang in networked and distributed environments.

6. **Resource Pooling System**: Build a system that manages a pool of resources (like connections, threads, etc.) and balances the load among them. This could be a good way to show off skills in resource management and efficiency.

7. **Blockchain Simulator**: Develop a simple blockchain-based application, such as a basic cryptocurrency, to understand the blockchain technology and consensus algorithms in a concurrent environment.

8. **Stock Ticker Application**: Create an application that streams stock market data in real-time and performs simple analyses. This project would involve handling high-throughput, low-latency processing.

9. **Multi-user Blog Platform**: Build a blogging platform where users can post, edit, and comment on articles concurrently. This can showcase database interactions, user authentication, and concurrency management.

10. **Distributed Database**: Implement a simple distributed key-value store to learn about data consistency, partitioning, and replication in distributed systems.
